"""One shared stdlib HTTP transport primitive for every network caller.

No third-party libraries — just ``urllib`` with a User-Agent, a timeout, optional
``Retry-After``-aware backoff, and a single structured error type. Each caller keeps
its own thin adapter (with its own return shape and error policy) on top of
:func:`request`; this module only owns the transport mechanics and the
``Retry-After`` parsing they all used to hand-roll.

Lives at the top level (sibling to ``config.py``) on purpose: the archival feature
is "optional/removable", but reddit/youtube/karakeep all depend on this primitive,
so it must not sit under ``archival/``.
