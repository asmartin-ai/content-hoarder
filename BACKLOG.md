# content-hoarder — feature backlog

Deferred ideas, grouped into epics. Each checkbox item is written to drop straight into a GitHub
issue (title = the bold line; body = the notes under it). Priorities: **P1** soon · **P2** next ·
**P3** someday. Suggested labels in `(…)`.

> When the repo is on GitHub: create the epics as Milestones (or `epic:*` labels) and paste each
> item as an issue. Templates live in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.

## Epic 1 — Content categorization: listenable / watch / wotagei  (`enhancement`, `area:youtube`)
*Motivation: many Watch-Later videos are "listenable" (music, podcasts, long-form discussion à la
Isaac Arthur / Perun) and can be processed passively; wotagei (ヲタ芸) should be handled in its own
area. Goal: tag videos so they can be filtered into dedicated "processing areas".*

- [x] ~~**Heuristic categorizer (no LLM first).**~~ Shipped: `categorize.py` + CLI `categorize`
  (`listenable`/`watch`/`wotagei`/`unknown` from duration ≥30min, a channel allowlist, and a wotagei
  title-keyword), stored on `metadata.category`. First run on WL2: listenable 626 / watch 1315 /
  wotagei 3 / unknown 3054 — re-tune the allowlist + thresholds in `categorize.py`.
- [x] ~~**"Processing areas" = category filters.**~~ Shipped: a category facet on `db.search_items`
  + `/items?category=` + the `#category` selector in the browse topbar.
- [ ] **P2 — Local-LLM auto-classify (`assist/llm.py`).** Classify from title + channel
  (listenable/watch/wotagei) with a manual override per item. Only after heuristics are validated.
- [x] ~~**Manual re-tagging UI.**~~ Shipped: a category chip-row on the triage card (youtube items)
  + `POST /items/<fn>/category` (validated, non-destructive). List-row picker left out to avoid
  clutter — triage is the focused single-item view.

## Epic 2 — YouTube metadata enrich  (`enhancement`, `area:youtube`)
*Motivation: `--flat-playlist` captures duration/channel but NOT category/tags/description, which
the categorizer (Epic 1) wants for accuracy.*

- [x] ~~**Per-video enrich pass.**~~ Shipped: `YouTubeConnector.enrich()` runs
  `yt-dlp --dump-single-json` per video to fill exact `duration`/`view_count`/`yt_categories`/`tags`/
  `description`/`channel`; `enrich --source youtube [--limit N]`, resumable via `hydrated_at`, lazy
  yt-dlp, unavailable videos stamped. (Full ~5k run deferred — slow; chunk with `--limit`.)

## Epic 3 — Recover deleted / private YouTube titles  (`enhancement`, `area:recovery`)
*Motivation: many WL items show as `[Private video]` / `[Deleted video]` with no title.*

- [x] ~~**Deleted-title recovery (opt-in enrich).**~~ Shipped: `youtube_recover.py` queries the
  **Wayback Machine** (availability API → snapshot → og:title) for `[Private/Deleted video]` items via
  `enrich --source youtube --titles [--limit N]`; non-destructive, resumable (`metadata.wayback_tried`),
  records `title_source`. Live sample recovered 1/3 (good for once-public *deleted*, nil for *private*,
  as expected). **filmot.com** is a future provider (needs an API key) — the HTTP fetcher is injectable.
  Refs: [filmot.com](https://filmot.com), [phloof/youtube-recovery-tool](https://github.com/phloof/youtube-recovery-tool).

## Epic 4 — Recover deleted Reddit content  (`enhancement`, `area:recovery`)
*Motivation: many saved posts/comments are now `[removed]`/`[deleted]`.*

- [x] ~~**Port the RSM `archival/` package.**~~ Shipped: `content_hoarder/archival/` (PullPush.io +
  Arctic-Shift, stdlib-only, non-destructive overlay, resumable via `hydrated_at`) behind
  `enrich --source reddit --archives [--limit N] [--all]`. Targets `[removed]`/`[deleted]` items and
  un-hydrated comment bodies. Refs: [pullpush.io](https://pullpush.io),
  [ArthurHeitmann/arctic_shift](https://github.com/ArthurHeitmann/arctic_shift).
- [x] ~~**On-demand single-item recovery in the UI.**~~ Shipped: `archival.recover_one()` +
  `POST /items/<fn>/recover` + a "↻ Recover" button on `[removed]`/`[deleted]` reddit cards that
  patches the title/body in place (throttle off).
- [ ] **P3 — Refine media metadata from the same fetch.** The local data has no `reddit_video`/
  `preview`, so media is currently inferred by URL heuristics (`media_type` = `reddit_video` for
  `v.redd.it`, else `reddit_media` for media posts with no captured URL). When the archival fetch runs,
  populate real `thumbnail`/`reddit_video` URLs and split `reddit_media` into precise image/video.

## Epic 5 — Inbox redesign follow-ups  (`enhancement`, `area:ui`)
*Shipped: bigger cards + list swipe + undo snackbar; **sources as top tabs**; **status as a left
sidebar** (with counts) + mobile hamburger drawer; **Gmail-style swipe-reveal icons** (trash/keep);
import modal; Keep/Archive/Done legend. Remaining patterns (ref
[team-inbox/inbox-reborn](https://github.com/team-inbox/inbox-reborn)):*

- [x] ~~**Sources as top tabs.**~~ Shipped (`#source-tabs`).
- [x] ~~**Status as a left sidebar.**~~ Shipped (`#status-nav` + mobile drawer).
- [x] ~~**Triage card parity.**~~ Shipped: Tinder-style swipe stamps + an inline Reddit click-to-load
  embed on the triage card.
- [ ] **P3 — Smooth drag-and-drop to buckets.** Drag cards onto category/status buckets.
  [SortableJS](https://github.com/SortableJS/Sortable) (~20 KB, touch-capable) or
  [html5sortable](https://github.com/lukasoppermann/html5sortable) (~4 KB).
- [ ] **P3 — Consolidate triage swipe onto `swipe.js`.** Refactor `triage.js` to use the shared
  `window.attachSwipe` helper (now also drives the list's icon reveal). Keep the verified behavior.
- [x] ~~**Cross-filtered counts.**~~ Shipped: `/stats?source=` + `/sources?status=` cross-filter the
  sidebar status counts and the source-tab counts (the tab list stays stable at 0).

## Epic 6 — Duplicates v2  (`enhancement`, `area:ui`)
*The first cut was removed: the "duplicate group" naming confused, and placeholder titles created
false positives.*

- [x] ~~**Redesign de-duplication (v2).**~~ Shipped: `dedup.py` non-destructive flag + reversible
  resolve via CLI `dedup [--by url|title] [--resolve] [--clear]`. **Excludes placeholder titles**
  (`[removed]`/`[deleted]`/`[Private video]`/`[Deleted video]`); URL grouping **keeps the query string**
  (a real-data scan caught the old code collapsing every `youtube.com/watch?v=…` into one group).
- [ ] **P3 — Duplicates review UI.** A clear "possible duplicates" surface (group cards → keep one,
  archive the rest) built on `dedup.find_groups`. The prior modal was removed for confusing UX —
  rebuild minimally; the CLI already does the work non-destructively.

## Epic 7 — More sources & live sync  (`enhancement`, `area:connectors`)
- [ ] **P2 — Import WL3 + Watch Later.** WL3 via the same `yt-dlp --flat-playlist` flow; main Watch
  Later via a browser-extension export (the connector already accepts a flat array).
- [ ] **P2 — Google Keep import.** Per-account Takeout → `import path/to/Keep` (connector exists;
  just needs the export).
- [x] ~~**Firefox tabs connector.**~~ Shipped: parses "Export Tabs URLs (Rich format)" .txt
  (title / url / favicon / window / pinned) → `firefox:<url-hash>` items, de-duped across the
  overlapping daily exports. Imported one sample (326 tabs). OneTab / `recovery.jsonlz4` remain future.
- [ ] **P3 — Live Reddit / YouTube API sync.** When API keys arrive, implement `BaseConnector.sync()`
  using the existing `auth_tokens` table.
- [ ] **P3 — Needs the API (keyless not possible):** (a) render **Reddit gallery images** inline — the
  archives keep `is_gallery` but drop `media_metadata`, and reddit `.json` is 403 without OAuth; (b) the
  true **"date added to Watch Later"** for YouTube (`playlistItems.publishedAt`). Keyless stopgaps already
  shipped: galleries relabel to "🖼 Gallery"; sort by **playlist position**; score/upvote hydration via
  the archives (`enrich --source reddit --scores`).

## Epic 8 — Polish & infra  (`chore`)
- [x] ~~**`.gitattributes`**~~ Shipped (`* text=auto eol=lf` + binary excludes) — stops CRLF warnings.
- [ ] **P3 — Optional Karakeep bridge** (already a stub) if a stock instance is adopted for a
  forward-capture library.
